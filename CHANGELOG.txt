# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]
### Note
- Add 1.0.0 to Repo

## [0.0.1] - 2016-06-26 [INITIAL]
### Added
- This CHANGELOG file to hopefully serve as a point of reference for
everyone working on the Pokemon Conjure team.
- Created the git itself.
- Used the rombase of Pokefreak890 as the starting point on a vanilla Firered rom, v1.0.
- Added my rombase which includes JPANS save block patch and other fixes.
- Going to fork from here a major change.

## [Key Notes] - 2016-06-26
### Note
- 0.0.1 is a special patch. This is the one and only time that one needs to
patch it to a clean rom. The rest of the patches will be independent, that is
you can patch ANY of them to the 0.0.1 patch and play.

### Note
- The only time we change the X in X.Y.Z is when something REALLY major happens.
This can be either a huge overall graphics improvement, or the addition of some major
ASM Code that changes everything. We may also use this for REALLY major events in game
where we feel a break point is needed.
- After major in-game events, such as beating a gym, the increment will be the Y in X.Y.Z.
- After regular changes like fully developing route one, the increment will be the Z in X.Y.Z.
