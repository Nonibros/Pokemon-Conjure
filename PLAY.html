<p>Thanks you for your interest in Pokémon Conjure!</p>

<p>Some people have had issues with patching and understanding what in general to do, so this page is simply a page which explains what tools are needed.</p>

<p>This page is also here so as to not anger any mods on the Pokecommunity whom understandably don't want to get in trouble because of suggesting a link to a website which has a ROM, due to legal trouble and what not.</p>

<p>So, this page was made to get past those rules using a friendly little guide, which is NOT (and I read them very well) against the aforemeantioned rules.</p>

<p>Finally, as I am not with the Pokecommunity, it is my right as a user to create any guide I wish, without adding an illegal ROM file here, and yet be able to point to what you need.</p>

<p>With that said, lets begin.</p>

<h3>
<a id="how-to-play" class="anchor" href="#how-to-play" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How to Play</h3>

<p>First thing first. You need the ROM. Emuparadise is a <b>fantastic</b> site for any of your ROM needs, and it is where we will be obtaining our ROM.</p>

<p>The link to the website (and ROM) is <a href="http://www.emuparadise.me/Nintendo_Gameboy_Advance_ROMs/Pokemon_Fire_Red_%28U%29%28Squirrels%29/44874">here</a>.</p>

<p>Next you need NUPS, which is <a href="http://www.romhacking.net/download/utilities/606/">here</a>.</p>

<p>You need to download the 0.0.1 patch and then patch it using nups to the Firered ROM <b>first</b>.</p>

<p>After that is done <b>then</b> you patch the current version patch to your 0.0.1 patched Firered. It will be good to keep the 0.0.1.zip, as any new versions you get must be patch to that version.</br>It is the base, so to speak, upon which all others are built.</p>

<p>You're done! Get to playing!

<a id="video" class="anchor" href="#video" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Video</h3>

<p>For those whom really need help, I have made a short and small video illustrating everything to do in a firefox browser. That video is <a href="http://">here</a>.</p>
