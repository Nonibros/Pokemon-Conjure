There is a note in the plant:

Let's play a game.

Here are some clues for the game.
Follow them in order for a prize!

Every tool has a purpose.
I'm kicking butt.
What a blue tree?
I love the outdoors.
I can't sit still.

I come to this land from the South, and to the East I see?

I love cake!
A very smart tree!

I'm in the middle of the rug?!
Face me mortal!

What the heck does this mean?
