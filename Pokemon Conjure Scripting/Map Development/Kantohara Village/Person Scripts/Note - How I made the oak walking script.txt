To illistrate what I did to get the movements.
movement(direction) is how oak and the player move when facing oak from that direction
I physically moved the npcs to get this, so do that when calculating what movement's you'll need.
Also, you'll notice that in all three movements, I made a movement that applies to all directions for both oak and the player, which saves space and gives the script a clean look.
What you can do with that information is, after moving a player movements compatible to the way you talk to the NPC, you can go to a general script, which will move them the rest of the way, open the door, and make them disappear.
So, I decided for each movement, "when player is facing oak from direction X, how should oak and the player move."
These non-code movements are what I got. Then, I translated them into the code.
