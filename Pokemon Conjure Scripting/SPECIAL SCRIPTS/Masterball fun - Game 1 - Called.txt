' This is for a fun little side game to obtain a master ball.
' In short, it will check whether certain variables for specific people are activated or not, and activates these in an order.
' So, one must talk to one object, another, etc etc, in a SPECIFIED order.
' A hint can be placed somewhere detailing, in a type of code or whatever, the order.

' This portion will run a universal script that will check your stored variable for the object or person, the checking variable against it, and if stored = check, then set the stored varible to next variable.
' The Script:

#org @checkmasterballorder
compare 0xstoredx 0xfinalvar ' We need to check whether we are in the final item of the masterball check. Final var is replace with the last object you want. Say you have a game with 6 people. 0x(finalvar) would = 5.
if 0x1 goto @finalflag ' If we are at the final object, we need to set a specific flag to say that we are in the final version.
compare 0xstoredx 0xcheckx ' We then compare our STORED variable to the checking variable.
if 0x1 goto @nextvar ' If they are =, we will change stored variable + 1.
goto @resetvar ' If they are not =, reset stored variable to 0.
end

#org @finalflag ' Here we set our final flag. When we come back to the script that called this, if this flag is set to true, we should run a custom script.
setflag 0xfinalx
return

#org @nextvar
copyvar 0xstoredx 0xnextx ' Since we have passed the check, we store into stored variable our next checking variable, which is the object number.
return

#org @resetvar
setvar 0xstoredx 0x0 ' Reset stored variable to 0, return to the script.
