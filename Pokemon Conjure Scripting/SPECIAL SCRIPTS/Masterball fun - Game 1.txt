' This is for a fun little side game to obtain a master ball.
' In short, it will check whether certain variables for specific people are activated or not, and activates these in an order.
' So, one must talk to one object, another, etc etc, in a SPECIFIED order.
' A hint can be placed somewhere detailing, in a type of code or whatever, the order.

' This portion will run a universal script that will check your stored variable for the object or person, the checking variable against it, and if stored = check, then set the stored varible to next variable.
' The Script:

#org @checkmasterballorder
comparevars 0x5100 0x4002 ' We then compare our STORED variable to the checking variable.
if 0x1 goto @nextvar ' If they are =, we will change stored variable + 1.
comparevars 0x5100 0x4003 ' Compare our STORED variable to the next variable to see if we've talked to this person right before, so we don't reset.
if 0x1 goto @justreturn ' Keep stored variable the same by not doing anything.
goto @resetvar ' If they are not =, reset stored variable to 0.
end

#org @nextvar
copyvar 0x5100 0x4003 ' Since we have passed the check, we store into stored variable our next checking variable, which is the object number.
return

#org @justreturn
return ' We will not do anything but instead we will just return.

#org @resetvar
setvar 0x5100 0x0 ' Reset stored variable to 0, return to the script.
