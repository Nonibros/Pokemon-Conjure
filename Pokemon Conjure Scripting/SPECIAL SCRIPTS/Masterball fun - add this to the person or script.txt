' Main Function
'---------

#org @callingscript ' This is the part that calls the order checking script. INSERT THIS INTO A SCRIPT TO CHECK THE OBJECT.
' This portion sets a checking variable to check the current order of the items we have entered.
' We change 0x(check)x to our temporary checking variable. This is = to the objects place in line, let's for example use the 5th object, - 1. so 5th object - 1 = 4.
' We set 0x(next)x to = the objects place in line. I.e 5th object.
' 0x(final)x is the flag set to the particular version of the masterball game you are playing. It is set once the game is complete, i.e. you have talked to the last object. We use this here both to prevent unnecessary execution of the other script and for the last object, to play a function.
' The Script:

checkflag 0xfinalx ' Checks whether we have reached the final object in the order script.
if 0x1 goto @continuex ' If we have, just continue on. If not, set up the variables and check.
setvar 0xcheckx 0xobj-1 'Set our checking variable = the object orders number - 1. Eg. 5th object in line would be 4.
setvar 0xnextx 0xobj 'Set our checking variable = the object orders number. Eg. 5th object in line would be 5. This is for the next check. This line is Not NEEDED FOR the LAST OBJECT.
call @checkmasterballorder ' Call the order checking script offset. This is in another file.
goto @continuex ' Continue on.
end ' We end here.
