FKA Reserved Flags and Variables.txt


This is a file displaying what variables have already been used, and what can be used.
As you can see, we have a few already.
When blocks are assigned to people working on the project, they will also get flag assignments and variable assignments.
Refer to EXAMPLE.txt for a concreted example.

Block areas:
0x7F8000 - 0x7FFFFF is where ASM code is kept.
If the project needs more then this, either Nonibros or Hajima will find a new space for it.

0x1200000 - 0x123FFFF is for general scripts.
[Nonibros], the scripting coordinator will give out a block to people working on the project.

IF YOU ARE NOT NONIBROS DO NOT TOUCH THIS AREA.
0x1240000 - 0x1247FFF is a special scripting area.
Instead, if you are working on the project, and a specific flag or variable needs to be set so someone doesn't show up at the beginning of the game, let Nonibros know.

Block 0x1240000 - 0x1241FFF is for the initial flag and varible setting script.

Block 0x1242000 - 0x1242FFF is for healing scripts after being healed. This area is not to be touched.

Block 0x1243000 - 0x12432FF is a table for maps to point to their healing locations.

Block 0x1243300 - 0x1243FFF is for the healing locations.

Block 0x1244000 - 0x1244FFF is for the masterball games.

Block 0x1247000 - 0x12477FF is for setting good variables and flags after talking to Kol.

Block 0x1247800 - 0x1247FFF is for setting evil variables and flags after talking to Kol.
 
0x1250000 - 0x126FFFF is for level scripts.
[Nonibros] will give out a block to people working on the project.

0x1270000 - 0x1300000 is a secondary area for general scripts.
[Nonibros], the scripting coordinator will give out a block to people working on the project.

0x1500000 - 0x17FFFFF is for Map Insertions.
The map coordinator will give out a block to people working on the project.

0x1800000 - 0x1AFFFFF is for Overworld/Tile Insertions.
The Tile insertion coordinator will give out a block to people working on the project.

Blocks will be given out to people working on a project, in groups of 0x8000.
If someone needs more then their assigned block, they can ask their project cooridinator for a new block.

Using this system, people working on the project will not run into each others work, and possibly break the game.

People will be assigned specific maps to work on at set times.
NO two people should be working on the same map at the same time.
Using this system again, prevents conflicts.





Now for the reserved section.
