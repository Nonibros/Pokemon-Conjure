<h1 style="text-align: center;">Pokémon Conjure Change Log</h1>

<p style="text-align: center;">Latest update: June 29th 2016</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This change log is for the Pokémon Firered hack, Pokémon Conjure by Hajima and Nonibros. The thread containing the details on the project can be found <a href="http://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?p=9255238">here</a>.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://github.com/Nonibros/Pokemon-Conjure">here</a> for the GitHub project.</p>

<h1>A few things</h1>

<p>Thank you everyone for your interest in this project! We really appreciate the support we have received so far from the community!</p>

<p>If you have any features or suggestions for the project, PM Nonibros or Hajima on the <a href="http://www.pokecommunity.com/">forums</a>.</p>

<p>If you find any bugs, or there are broken parts of the game, PM Nonibros or Hajima on the <a href="http://www.pokecommunity.com/">forums</a>.</p>

<h2>Key Notes</h2>

<h3>Note</h3>

<ul>
<li>0.0.1 is a special patch. This is the one and only time that one needs to patch it to a clean rom. The rest of the patches will be independent, that is you can patch ANY of them to the 0.0.1 patch and play.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Note</h3>

<ul>
<li>The only time we change the X in X.Y.Z in our version number is when something REALLY major happens. This can be either a huge overall graphics improvement, or the addition of some major ASM Code that changes everything. We may also use this for REALLY major events in game where we feel a break point is needed.</li>
<li>After major in-game events, such as beating a gym, the increment will be the Y in X.Y.Z.</li>
<li>After regular changes like fully developing route one, the increment will be the Z in X.Y.Z.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>Some people have found a easter egg and think it's a glitch or broken game. It's not. To those whom don't know, you might find it.</p>
<p>HINT 1: It's only for the bad side.</p>
<p>HINT 2: It's between Route 1 and Kantohara.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<p>These issues are known by the developers and are being worked on.</p>

<ul>
<li>The first house in Thimble Town has a broken warp that breaks the game. THIS HAS been changed right now so that the houses cant be entered.</li>
</ul>

<p>These issues are known by the developers but won't be fixed.</p>

<ul>
<li>When walking to the lab, it's possible for Oak to walk through the old lady. This won't be changed because a fan told me it's funny. :)</li>
</ul>

<h2>[1.0.3] - 2016-06-29</h2>

<h3>Added</h3>

<ul>
<li>Completed the trainers on Route 1. They now look pretty good.</li>
<li>Made two new flags, 0x15A and 0x15B, that will control OW characters for each side. Details in RESERVED.txt</li>

<li>JPAN's black out ASM. Now when the all the players Pokémon faint, they will teleport home.</li>
<li>Bed. Now you can sleep in your room, and it acts as a Pokémon Center.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Changed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Kol/???'s Script to reflect new 0x15A and 0x15B flags.</li>
<li>Kantohara's map a bit. It now looks a bit better IMO.</li>
<li>Route 2's map a bit.</li>
<li>The NPC that was at the lower right of Kantohara is now gone.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed</h3>

<ul>
<li>You now teleport home instead of fighting Blane.</li>
</ul>

<h2>[1.0.2] - 2016-06-27</h2>

<h3>Changed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Extended Route 1 so that the trainer near the exit doesn't just "appear."</li>
<li>Changed the wild pokemon on Route 1 to make them easier to fight. Machop in particular insta-killed Larvitar, so he is now more rare to find. If you do find him however, RUN!</li>
<li>Cleared out and re-made the dude in green's dialogue to fix a spelling mistake.</li>
<li>Moved the mother and Verne outside until I can fix the issues.</li>
<li>Opened Route 2, though it has not been edited yet.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Advance Map was having some issues. I filled in all random empty space between 0x1500000 - 0x1504A00.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Attempted</h3>

<ul>
<li>A failed second map for Thimble Town to try to fix some glitches.</li>
</ul>

<h2>[1.0.1] - 2016-06-26</h2>

<h3>Added</h3>

<ul>
<li>Completed all the NPC's in Professor Oaks Lab.</li>
<li>Added a nice little event between an aide in Kantohara and Verne in Thimble Town.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fixed</h3>

<ul>
<li>Professor Oaks script. It had issues with saying next item instead of first item for the bad side.</li>
<li>Professor Oaks script again. He faced down instead of the direction of the player after picking up the pokedex.</li>
<li>TEMP - Fixed the first house in Thimble Town by making it locked for now. It seems that it DOES warp the player to the same layout as the house, because you can see Verne, but with the graphical overlay of Thimble Town.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Broken</h3>

<ul>
<li>Somehow the second house in Thimble broke. So, I will probably have to recreate the entire map.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Added</h3>

<ul>
<li>This is where everything is added that was finished before making the Git.</li>

</ul>

<h2>[0.0.1] - 2016-06-26 [INITIAL]</h2>

<h3>Added</h3>

<ul>
<li>This CHANGELOG file to hopefully serve as a point of reference for everyone working on the Pokémon Conjure team.</li>
<li>I created this HTML file and the GitHub page.</li>
<li>Used the rombase of Pokefreak890 as the starting point on a vanilla Firered rom, v1.0.</li>
<li>Added my rombase which includes JPANS save block patch and other fixes.</li>
