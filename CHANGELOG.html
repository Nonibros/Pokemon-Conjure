<h2>[Key Notes] - 2016-06-26</h2>

<h3>Note</h3>

<ul>
<li>0.0.1 is a special patch. This is the one and only time that one needs to patch it to a clean rom. The rest of the patches will be independent, that is you can patch ANY of them to the 0.0.1 patch and play.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Note</h3>

<ul>
<li>The only time we change the X in X.Y.Z is when something REALLY major happens. This can be either a huge overall graphics improvement, or the addition of some major ASM Code that changes everything. We may also use this for REALLY major events in game where we feel a break point is needed.</li>
<li>After major in-game events, such as beating a gym, the increment will be the Y in X.Y.Z.</li>
<li>After regular changes like fully developing route one, the increment will be the Z in X.Y.Z.</li>
</ul>

<p>Some people have found a easter egg and think it's a glitch or broken game. It's not. To those whom don't know, you might find it. :)</p>
